# Security Audit Plan

This document outlines the steps for a code audit based on the "Security Audit" section of `docs/NextSteps.md`.

## Scope
According to `NextSteps.md`, the external review should include:
- Cryptography implementation
- Network handling
- Data storage
- Process isolation

Penetration testing should cover:
- Network security
- Application security
- System security
- Privacy protections

## Methodology
1. **Code Review**
   - Examine `src-tauri` for correct usage of TLS and certificate pinning.
   - Review session management in `src-tauri/src/session.rs` and `state.rs`.
   - Inspect frontâ€‘end code in `src/` for secure IPC calls and proper data handling.
   - Run `cargo audit` and `npm audit` / `bun audit` for dependency checks.
2. **Static Analysis**
   - Use tools like `clippy` for Rust and `svelte-check` for Svelte components.
3. **Penetration Testing**
   - Simulate network attacks against the application APIs.
   - Validate sandboxing and process isolation features.
4. **Reporting**
   - Document all findings in `docs/SecurityFindings.md` with severity and recommended fixes.

## Timeline
- Preparation: 1 week
- Code analysis: 2 weeks
- Penetration tests: 1 week
- Reporting: 1 week

## Responsibilities
- Lead Auditor: coordinates the review
- Developers: provide code context and implement fixes
