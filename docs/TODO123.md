# TODO - Next Steps

All outstanding issues have been resolved. The application is now in a complete and robust state.

- [x] **Refactor Backend Architecture:** Logic has been encapsulated in `tor_manager.rs`.
- [x] **Implement Missing Functions:** `get_active_circuit` and `new_identity` are now fully functional.
- [x] **Remove Frontend Placeholders:** All mock data and placeholder logic in the UI have been replaced with calls to the live backend.
- [x] **Update Documentation:** All documentation has been updated to reflect the final state of the project.
